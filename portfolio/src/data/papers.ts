    title: "Passenger-Oriented Intelligent Suspension with a Biodynamic Model and Skyhook Control",
    journal: "Proceedings of the Latin American Congress on Automation and Robotics",
    year: "2021",
    date: "21 November 2021",
    authors: "R. Granados-Monge, J. Montaño-Moreno, G. Quiroga-Ocaña, C. S. Díaz-Choque, L. C. Félix-Herrán, R. A. Ramírez-Mendoza",

    abstract: "Intelligent suspension systems assist in decreasing the impact of road disturbances on passenger comfort, and its design requires a mathematical analysis that includes the elements of the suspension and the passenger's vertical dynamics. The contribution of this research is to merge a 4 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) Boileau-Rakheja biodynamic passenger model with a 3-DOF suspension model to generate more accurate representations of the displacements and accelerations of the main passenger's masses. Moreover, the contribution is complemented with a Skyhook controller in a semi-active 7-DOF one-quarter vehicle suspension to improve passenger comfort.",
