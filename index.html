								<h3>Passenger-Oriented Intelligent Suspension with a Biodynamic Model and Skyhook Control</h3>
								<h4>21 November 2021 | Proceedings of the Latin American Congress on Automation and Robotics</h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h5>Abstract</h5>
								<p align="justify">Intelligent suspension systems assist in decreasing the impact of road disturbances on passenger comfort, and its design requires 
									a mathematical analysis that includes the elements of the suspension and the passenger’s vertical dynamics. 
									The contribution of this research is to merge a 4 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) Boileau-Rakheja biodynamic passenger model with a 3-DOF 
									suspension model to generate more accurate representations of the displacements and accelerations of the main passenger’s masses. 
									Moreover, the contribution is complemented with a Skyhook controller in a semi-active 7-DOF one-quarter vehicle suspension to 
									improve passenger comfort, and a case study presents tests in frequency and time domains. The analysis was conducted by establishing a 
									regulatory closed-loop feedback control for a state-space system, simulating its behavior using MATLAB/Simulink, and comparing the 
									results against specific performance criteria. The active suspension’s frequency response showed a 40% reduction in the 
									displacement transmissibility of the suspended masses at low frequencies (0–4 Hz), but exhibited a 2–10% increase in the rms acceleration at high frequencies (4–15 Hz). The herein results 
									could be the base for further studies in the passenger comfort and road holding for one quarter, but also for half and full vehicle. </p>

								<h3>Computing and Assessment of Discrete Angle Positions for Optimizing the Solar Energy Harvesting for Urban Sustainable Development</h3>
								<h4>9 Octuber 2021 | MDPI energies</h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h5>Abstract</h5>
								<p align="justify">This paper proposes the computation and assessment of optimal tilt and azimuth angles for a receiving surface, using a mathematical 
									model developed at the University of Tomsk, Russia. The model was validated and analyzed for the Nuevo León State, Northeast Mexico, utilizing a set of metrics, comparing against satellite data from NASA. 
									A point of interest in the city of Monterrey was analyzed to identify orientation patterns throughout the year for an optimal solar energy gathering. The aim is providing the best orientation tilt angles 
									for photovoltaic or solar thermal panels without tracking systems. In addition, this analysis is proposed as a tool to achieve 
									optimal performance in sustainable urban development in the region. Based on the findings, a set of optimal tilt and azimuth surface angles are proposed for the analyzed coordinates. 
									The aim is to identify the optimal performance to obtain the maximum solar irradiation possible over the year for solar projects in 
									the region. The results show that the model can be used as a tool to accelerate decision making in the design of solar harvesting 
									surfaces and allows the design of discrete tracking systems with an increase in solar energy harvesting above 5% annually.</p>

								<h3>Industrial Informatics</h3>
								<h4>2019</h4>
								<p align="justify">Our project consisted of designing and implementing a structure, whether for work or housing, with the aim 
									of conserving energy and maximizing its use. Additionally, we integrated features that promote water conservation and the 
									health of its occupants. Our solution relies on an array of sensors that regulate the use of energy and water. For example, 
									motion and photovoltaic sensors control the lighting system, while water sensors measure the garden's water levels and the 
									water tank. We also incorporated a fan that operates based on temperature readings and a servomotor that manages the water 
									tank's movement. All these functions work automatically to ensure energy efficiency, but we also provided an option for 
									manual control by the user. Our project was implemented using Arduino and LabVIEW, two widely used platforms for developing and prototyping control systems.
									Our motivation for this project stems from the realization that energy consumption is a 
									fundamental issue that cannot be ignored. While electricity is indispensable, we recognize that its misuse contributes 
									to unnecessary expenditures. As a result, our objective was to create a housing structure that promotes maximum energy 
									usage while minimizing energy expenses.</p>
